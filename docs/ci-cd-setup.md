# CI/CD Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## CI Workflow

The CI workflow is configured to run automatically on every push to any branch and on pull requests. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the code
2. Sets up a Java 17 environment
3. Builds the project with Maven
4. Runs all tests
5. Sets up Docker Buildx
6. Builds a Docker image from the project's Dockerfile

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Here's a breakdown of the configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ '*' ]  # Run on push to any branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '*' ]  # Run on pull requests to any branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: maven

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml

    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    - name: Build Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
      with:
        context: .
        push: false
        tags: spring-boot-starter:latest
        cache-from: type=gha
        cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Benefits

- **Automated Testing**: Every code change is automatically tested, ensuring that new changes don't break existing functionality.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Issues are caught early in the development process.
- **Consistent Build Environment**: The build environment is consistent for all developers and for production.
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers get quick feedback on their changes.
- **Docker Verification**: Every change is verified to build successfully as a Docker image, ensuring containerization works properly.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the CI/CD pipeline could include:

1. **Automated Deployments**: Automatically deploy to development, staging, or production environments based on branch or tag.
2. **Code Quality Checks**: Integrate tools like SonarQube for code quality analysis.
3. **Security Scanning**: Add security vulnerability scanning.
4. **Performance Testing**: Incorporate performance tests for critical paths.
5. **Docker Image Publishing**: Automatically push Docker images to a container registry.
